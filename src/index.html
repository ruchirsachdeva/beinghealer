<!--  Preload home-bg.jpg and our-provide-2.jpg as they are first to be painted on homepage. Other images loaded on homepage are set as lazy, so that they load in the end.
      If we preload all the images, it will block the loading of other important resources like js, css unnecessarily!
      Further, since home-bg.jpg and our-provide-2.jpg are using background-image(url), so some tricks had to be done to preload them
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74732788/why-is-the-the-background-image-url-name-different-from-the-local-image-name-a
      1. With outputHashing = all "js and url(image_path), and url(font_path) etc resources get optimized and output-hashed, the purpose being to destroy the browser cache if there is one.
         So the background-image: url('../img/home-bg.jpg'); was renderd in production as http://www.beinghealer.com/home-bg.1c0835203511d0a3.jpg
         While the link preload below preloaded http://www.beinghealer.com/assets/img/home-bg.jpg"
         So, outputHashing = all was changed to outputHashing = bundles, after which background-image was renderd without hash in production as http://www.beinghealer.com/home-bg.jpg
      2. Further, notice that the preloaded image is http://www.beinghealer.com/assets/img/home-bg.jpg, and the rendered background image is http://www.beinghealer.com/home-bg.jpg
         So, I made another copy of home-bg.jpg in the "src" folder, and then the below preloading works fine for the background-image in "assets"
         Also note that this issue does nnot happen for <img src="assets/img/xx.jpeg" />, which is rendered with full path (http://www.beinghealer.com/assets/img/xx.jpg). Issue is only with "background-image"
